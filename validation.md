## A device component is used
You're wondering around in a shop and then you notice an interesting book. You decide to purchase it and so you added to your awesome library manager. You open the application, click on the plus, then the camera on the top right. The device's camera opens and you pass it on the books barcode. The search field is filled with the books ISBN code and you click on the search button, then which the app will use one of Google Books API to find the book. Once the found the book, a popup appears and shows it to you.

## Data is stored on the device
A week has passed, you've finished your book. You then decided to go on your app to set the book as read, favorite it, rate it and comment it. Once you've opened the app, you click on the book to open its detailed page. On the new page, you click on the eye and the star to set it as read and favorite, then you click on the dropdown to give it a rating out of ten. You then add a comment by clicking on the empty space at the bottom of the page. To save all of the changes, you click on the "done" icon on the top right.

## Internet problems
It's been a few weeks that you've had internet problems, but you're happy with your app. When in the app you can see all of your books. The only down side is that all of the book covers are replaced by a default image.

## API down and changing API
You tried adding books, but the app kept telling you that no books were found and to check the ISBN code and your internet, which you've done. After a bit of research you find out that the API the app uses is down. So you decide to use the app settings to change the API so you can add your books. On the main page of the app, you click on the settings button on the top right, then you type in the url to the new API the app should use. To confirm the changes, you click on the save button on the top right.
